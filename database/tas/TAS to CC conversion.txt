Prerequesites:
	- All training requests must be accepted
	- TAS must be closed for new requests to avoid duplicates and complications.
	- Add temporary position id 400 "Unknown" that need to be manually overwritten later on
	- Add temporary position id 401 "ESSA_TWR" 
	- Add temporary position id 402 "ESSA_APP"
	- 403 "ENGM_APP", 404 "ENGM_TWR"

1. Make a table of all user-dependecies to feed to Handover to avoid non-existing user errors later on
	- Go through all trainings in SCA vacc and the student's CIDs
	- Go through all ACTIVE trainings in SCA, and the mentor's CIDs.
	- Go through all reports in SCA and the author's CIDs.
	- This can then be exported as INSERT IGNORE format for Handover

2. Transfer all trainings from SCA
	- Link up the training to the student's user
	- Link up the training to the correct rating
	- Link up the training to the correct country
	- Link up created/ended dates

3. Transfer all reports from SCA that are linked to the trainings in previous point
	- Concat focus points and comments to the report field
	- Copy improvements to improvement field
	- Copy created date

4. Transfer all examination results
	- Copy the exam in itself
	- Populate `files` and `training_object_attachments` correctly to upload all attachments to files/legacy

Notes:
- Mentors need to be re-assigned manually (caution about emails)
- Long term paused trainings need to be paused again manually and timestamp revised in DB
- Exam positions that are unknown need to be manually assigned to correct position.

Todo:
- Transfer ratings with PHP
- Trasnfer file attachments with PHP
